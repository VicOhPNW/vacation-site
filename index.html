          <p class="bg-success">"People said If you travel to Vietnam and missing Ha Long Bay that is so regret. Just explore this Bay 1 time in your life and You had to be surprised by breathtaking view. It is a huge construction was designed by the Mother of nature with many rocks, limestone and island. It takes you 3,5 hours from The Oldquarter get to Ha Long Bay . It is easy to catch a shuttle bus in the morning or make a booking on online or travel agent ( highly at the travel agent because they supply some useful information). Overnight on cruise is unforgettable experience with excellent service from crews."</p>
